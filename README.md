# Number-pattern-programs-in-C
Number pattern is a series of numbers arranged in specific order. 
These patterns are patterns created by numbers and are similar to star patterns. 
They are best suited to enhance your logical thinking abilities and to practice flow control statements.
In these programs nested looping is done where the first loop changes the line and other nested loops are used to print the number patterns.
It is really wonderful to note that all these programs have wide range applications as well.
